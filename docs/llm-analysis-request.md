```

### 2. Claude Flow Orchestration System
**Philosophy**: "Claude Flow coordinates, Claude Code creates"

**MCP Server Architecture**:
- `claude-flow@alpha`: Primary coordination (70+ tools)
- `ruv-swarm`: Enhanced coordination (optional)
- `flow-nexus`: Cloud features (optional)

**Key MCP Tools**:
- `swarm_init`: Initialize agent topology
- `agent_spawn`: Define agent types
- `task_orchestrate`: High-level planning
- `memory_usage`: Cross-session persistence
- `neural_train`: Pattern learning

### 3. Claude Code Integration
**Agent Execution Model**:
- 54 specialized agents (backend-dev, tester, reviewer, etc.)
- Concurrent execution via Task tool
- Hooks integration for safety and coordination
- Memory persistence across sessions

**Golden Rule**: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"
- Batch all todos in single calls
- Spawn all agents concurrently
- Parallel file operations
- Memory operations batched together

### 4. Git Worktree Architecture
**Three Canonical Worktrees**:

1. **env-setup** (Port 8188):
   - Environment Specialist: Python/PyTorch/CUDA compatibility
   - Package Manager: Custom nodes and dependencies
   - Validation Engineer: Environment testing

2. **models-integ** (Port 8189):
   - File System Mapper: Model path discovery
   - Configuration Expert: YAML template generation
   - Integration Specialist: SwarmUI compatibility

3. **ops-maint** (Port 8190):
   - Systems Administrator: systemd services
   - Log Analyst: Pattern recognition and triage
   - Repair Technician: Automated diagnostics

### 5. Maintenance Automation Philosophy
**Core Principles**:
- **Reproducibility**: Locked environments with requirements.lock
- **Observability**: Structured logging with Claude Flow analysis
- **Self-Healing**: Automated repair with human review
- **Portability**: Machine-adaptable configurations
- **Documentation**: Decision logging and session summaries

**Health Monitoring**:
- Real-time API connectivity checks
- Custom node dependency validation
- System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, GPU)
- Model path validation
- Service status monitoring

## CURRENT CHALLENGES & OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. Git Integration Challenges
- **Current**: Manual commit messages, basic logging
- **Opportunity**: Automatic change detection, semantic commits, deployment tracking

### 2. Logging System Limitations
